    "- Ideally, the estimated performance of a model tells how well it performs on unseen data – making predictions on future data is often the main problem we want to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"1.2\"></a>**Model selection** - We want to increase the predictive performance by tweaking the learning algorithm and selecting the best performing model from a given hypothesis space.\n",
    "- Typically, machine learning involves a lot of experimentation. Running a learning algorithm over a training dataset with different hyperparameter settings and different features will result in different models. Since we are typically interested in selecting the best-performing model from this set, we need to find a way to estimate their respective performances in order to rank them against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"1.3\"></a>**Algorithm selection** - We want to compare different ML algorithms, selecting the best-performing one.\n",
    "- We are usually not only experimenting with the one single algorithm that we think would be the “best solution” under the given circumstances. More often than not, we want to compare different algorithms to each other, oftentimes in terms of predictive and computational performance.\n",

In fact it is easier to work with MSE. But there is a little bit of difference between the two for gradient-based models. The gradient of RMSE with respect to i-th prediction is basically equal to gradient of MSE multiplied by some value. The value doesn't depend on the index I. It means that travelling along MSE gradient is equivalent to traveling along RMSE gradient but with a different flowing rate and the flowing rate depends on MSE score itself. So, it is kind of dynamic.So even though RMSE and MSE are really similar in terms of models scoring, they can be not immediately interchangeable for gradient based methods. We will probably need to adjust some parameters like the learning rate.\n",

    " + However, this may be a signal to review your EDA\n",
    " + If there is a huge gap between validation and lb, while train and val scores are similar - you have a leak in data. Carefuly review your EDA. Try to remove most predictive features and compare the results\n",
    " + Always try to look not only at F1 score but also on precision and recall (FP, FN) to find out when your model is wrong\n",
    " + Holdout validation works very good when you have a lot of data points in Neural Networks for example\n",
    " + Don't waste your time on building complex models to see if your validation is working. You should see this even submitting a constant value. Concentrate on very simple model such as linear/logistic regression for this\n",
    " + If you have time and ran out of ideas, you can use the next trick - concatenate train and test sets. Create a variable that will have a value 'train' for examples in train set or 'test' otherwise. Build a classifier that will try to predict whether an example belongs to either of two groups. After that from select top examples with highest probability to be included in test and make them your validation.\n",
    " + There is a possibility to GridSearch and compare algorithms using statistical significance of Student criteria. The link to review this idea https://youtu.be/HT3QpRp2ewA?t=1071 "
